            You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that work.
            That's
            why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web Developer.

            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and showed it
            to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming.
